# Messcrypt
Looking to keep something a secret? How about encrypting that secret with an image.
The image key can be an image already in your camera roll which means there is no need to keep a long encryption key around.

## Crypto
The Node.js Crypto module is used here for the encrypting and decrypting of messages. 
The way the AES encryption key is generating depends on the image keyâ€™s data URL representation. 
Decryption generates a key using this method in reverse.


## Still in development
A lot of the main functionality has been implemented. The features page, contact page, and the help tab still need to be set up.
